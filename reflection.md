- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
My initial thoughts is that this actually makes sense to me. I'm definitly starting to get more comfortable coding in Java. The inheritence is definitly super useful. 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What didn't work for me at first was understanding the structure of this all. It really helped me to draw out a mini "family tree" of all the classes, including what makes them unique. I highly recommend doing this as it makes it much easier to understand.
